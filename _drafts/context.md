fitting in

Whenever I had a question for for my father as a child, his first response was always, "what's the context?" (paraphrased from Korean). After several years of then asking "what's context?", and never getting a satisfactory answer, my Korean vocabulary improved enough to understand what his response meant… I think.
 
Is my question something he's equipped to answer?
 
He wasn't trying to be so frustratingly enigmatic. To be clear, if I pointed to a math problem and asked him, "Dad, what's 24x32?", he'd answer. However, if I asked him, "Dad how did you handle classmates calling you 'gook'?", he'd give me a hard look and respond with what I think was his best honestly-I-don't-know-son-but-I'm-sorry-people-are-awful-you-need-to-be-tougher response.

He had this infuriating habit of answering questions with perspective changes. What made those children sling a slur at me? Did i provoke them? Would my dad have had any experience, growing up in Korea - a largely homogeneous society - of dealing with race issues? 

As a child, this wasn't the most comforting response, but it evolved into one of the most important life lessons he's imparted… how do things (or people, or events) fit together?
