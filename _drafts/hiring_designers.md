for engineers

One of the things I (over)hear increasingly is that it's difficult to hire engineers. Most qualified candidates already have jobs and furthermore, companies are going to greater lengths to retain talent. When talented engineers do move, they often bypass the interview process and move to organizations where they already have contacts, friends, families, colleagues.

Typically, a position is posted, introductions through some means or other are made with candidates that meet some basic predetermined qualifications, (Ruby, Java, 5 years experience working on known properties, etc) and several rounds of live code sessions are planned to ensure the authenticity of the candidate's skills. While it's far from a perfect system, it largely works. 

Good engineers have a few well-defined characteristics. Writing the req' is fairly straight forward and a candidate is either able to fill those needs or they're unable (can the candidate write a "basic" crawler using a small dataset for _n_ results?). The difficult part often lies in matching their long term potential and temperament against the future of the organization and the personalities of the existing team.

Designers are also said to be a difficult hire, but for one significant difference.

Beyond the actually hiring, a designer is often asked to work on a broad array of projects involving design, regardless of whether they have experience in the particular discipline.
