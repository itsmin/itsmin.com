PRODUCT DESIGN

-----

2011 - Current
DIRECTOR OF USER EXPERIENCE / PRODUCT MANAGEMENT

GRACENOTE INC via
TRIBUNE MEDIA SERVICES via
CASTTV INC

I was the sole design resource for CastTV, a consumer website that, at peak, had over 4 million unique visitors a month. Because we were a very small team of six (including the founders) front-end code production and customer support was a significant part of my daily responsibilities. 

In 2011 CastTV was acquired by Tribune Media Services. While CastTV’s consumer properties were eventually shuttered, I continued to guide other design and user experience efforts within Tribune. After a brief period working with Tribune Digital Ventures, I returned to TMS to shore up design and UX efforts.

In 2014, Tribune Media Services adopted the Gracenote brand as the identity for the data products and services group. It was at this time I took on product management responsibilities. Under the auspices of user experience and design, I continue to facilitate collaboration between the many groups, offices and individuals of an ever growing Gracenote.

2004 - 2008
MANAGER OF CREATIVE SERVICES

ADMISSION CORPORATION via
IPIX CORPORATION

My original role at IPIX corporation was marketing designer. As the parent corporation, and our media management group, went through significant restructuring, I’d taken the opportunity to demonstrate my ambitions in product design. My collaboration with the product development team produced a new product portfolio strong enough to help convince outside investment to back an employee lead spin off (AdMission Corporation). AdMission Corporation’s assets were eventually acquired by ADP (via Cobalt). The applications I’d helped to develop are still in use today.

The most notable works from my advertising portfolio were all high profile projects where I enjoyed direct collaboration with the client. While I no longer seek agency work, I still enjoy working on projects that are highly collaborative and highly visible.

BFA / BARCH DEGREES CANDIDATE

RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN

I spent four years at RISD studying architectural design. An email sent to satisfy a curiosity lead to an summer internship and the not-so-slow reveal that a completely different possibility lay ahead.
