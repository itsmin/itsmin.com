<p><em>draft</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been a bit of a media glutton, collecting well over 500 DVDs during my college years, and hundreds of VHS tapes written and rewritten with the anime or kungfu flick dujour. A shared cable line in an off campus apartment brought about the KPOP music videos and TV commercials library. The point is, I&#39;ve always gone out of the way to not only watch, but gather, manage and share my media collections.</p>

<p>Fast forward several years and moves of several large/heavy boxes (full of DVDs, CDs, VCDs and hard drives) and I found myself as the sole design and user experience resource at a small startup called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CastTV">CastTV</a>. CastTV, in a nutshell, was a video search engine made visible to the public via a consumer website. </p>

<p>For the past 6 years, the bulk of my working hours have been spent on imagining some aspect of the experience of watching TV without a grid. More specifically, non-linear methods of discovering and consuming (nee watching) TV.</p>

<p>Since CastTV&#39;s acquisition by Tribune Media Services in 2010, and the subsequent shuttering of the consumer website, I&#39;ve had little professional reason to continue working on this &quot;new TV experience&quot; - and yet, here I am introducing <a href="https://github.com/itsmin">LanCaster</a>. </p>

<p>Lancaster is an evolving prototype, an interface to the experiences that happen before, during, and after a video is watched. I&#39;m sorting through my various documents, PSDs and projects in my local git repo; editing to put a presentable, sharable face on the project.</p>

<p>As I find myself returning to the enjoyment of the media I&#39;ve, in some form, tried to catalogue over the past few years, I wanted a snapshot to come back to. This is primarily a personal effort to archive my work with/for CastTV, the raw development of a portfolio piece...</p>

<p>...but I&#39;d be lying if I said the desired end result isn&#39;t a homebrew home entertainment system for <em>myself</em> that has aspirations beyond my walls. </p>
