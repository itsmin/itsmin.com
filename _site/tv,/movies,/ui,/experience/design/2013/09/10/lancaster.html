<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;ve always been a bit of a media glutton, collecting over 500 DVDs during my college years, and hundreds of VHS tapes written and rewritten with the anime or kungfu flick dujour. A shared cable line in an off campus apartment brought about the KPOP music video collection. The point is, I&#39;ve always gone out of the way to not only watch, but gather and manage and share my media collections.</p>

<p>Fast forward several years and moves of several large/heavy boxes (full of DVDs, CDs, VCDs and external drives) and I found myself as the sole UX resource at a small startup called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CastTV">CastTV</a>. CastTV, in a nutshell, was a video search engine made visible to the public via a consumer website. </p>

<p>For the past 6 years, the bulk of my working hours have been spent on imagining some aspect of the experience of watching TV without a grid. More specifically, non-linear methods of discovering and consuming (nee watching) TV.</p>

<p>Since CastTV&#39;s acquisition by TMS in 2010, and the subsequent shuttering of the consumer website, I&#39;ve had little professional reason to continue working on this &quot;new TV experience&quot; - and yet, here I am introducing <a href="https://github.com/itsmin">LanCaster</a>. </p>

<p>Lancaster is an evolving prototype, an interface to the experiences that happen before, during, and after a video is watched in <strong>my</strong> household. It&#39;s a homebrew home entertainment system that has big aspirations.  </p>
