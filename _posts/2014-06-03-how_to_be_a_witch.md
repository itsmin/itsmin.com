replacements for loved ones

My mother always knew how to be a witch, which was not as strange as you would think.

She would stroke my hair, whispering how much she loved me. She'd hold me tight and with a smile begin spinning us around and around saying, "spin me spin me spin me" as if she were the child, my surrogate voice while mine was too busy laughing.

Carlos and his sons were visiting as a demon overtook their home. It was nice having them over, playing checkers while my mother poured us tall glasses of lemonade that clinked and cracked as they were filled.

His sons would whisper things to each other, not in a rude manner, but in the way family members do when they don't want to burden you with their troubles.

With apologies and a sigh, Carlos eventually announced they "should go before things became really difficult". With a nod, his sons finished their lemonade and left for their home, ahead of their father, who was making apologies and thanks to my mother for the drinks and sympathy.

My mother always knew how to be a witch, which meant there was always a kind word given to a neighbor in need.

In my mind I saw a little girl wander into Carlos' yard. She had the quizzical look of someone running an errand. I saw innocent questions in her eyes, as a strangely large dog whose color was "off" bit her.

When I told Carlos he said, "run and help Samantha", not to me but to his sons. I guess they heard because I couldn't see them at the end of the street. He walked after them, gently closing the door behind him.

My mother always knew how to be a witch, she also knew the day she'd die.

Terrified at the idea of being eaten by a dog whose coat wasn't quite black, I ran to my mother, but remembered my manners and slowed to a walk. She was at the sink, the water running.

I tried to hold her with my little arms, mumbling "there, there", with my face buried in her dress. It always calmed me when she said it, but I was not a witch so the words held no magic.

She turned and held me tightly, too tightly. She lifted me as she started to spin, my legs banging into the chairs, table and now empty glasses of lemonade shattering them against the floor.

She growled, "spin me, spin me", as I looked up into Samantha's face, curious and, rabid? I reached out to stroke her fur, and whispered how much I loved her before my brothers pulled her away.

Carlos patted my head, and promised, "there, there. She won't feel a thing".

I always knew when poppa was lying. He'd always give me a glass of lemonade before breaking my heart.

My mother always knew how to be a witch, she left us to live our lives without her.
