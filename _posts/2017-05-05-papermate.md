Why I (lowercase) sketch

Capture

I was always a terrible note taker. You wouldn't be able to tell looking at the notes I scribble on my drawings, but I used to have a minor case of OCD when it comes to handwriting, more specifically, having perfect handwriting.
Vertical lines needed to be perfectly ninety degrees adjacent to the horizontal rules, every capital "A" on the page needed to be the same size, their bars the same distance from the apex. Needless to say, I was very bad at capturing entire lectures.
As a result, I discovered a couple of things about myself (that I somehow missed throughout my entire childhood); I have an above average short-term memory; note the emphasis on "short-term". My mind also has has a max-occupancy rating of not-nearly-enough.
I needed to find a more efficient way of capturing these thoughts and memories that didn't involve a drafting triangle and a pencil that needed constant sharpening. Enter the Paper♥︎♥︎Mate Flair® M pen (for brevity's sake, "PaperMate" henceforth).
Every day of drawing class involved our instructor telling us that drawing is about expression.
"Drawing comes from the crotch"
was a phrase that made it into the long term memory banks. I'd been trained to regard sketching with significantly less rigor than with my hand writing.
Sketching with a pen meant there was no going back, no way to erase what's already made it to paper. In other words, I had to simply keep sketching.
I started sketch-taking with a common Bic Cristal ballpoint pen, because they were available everywhere, and cheap.
One day, when the last bit of ink in the pen ran dry and refused to work (regardless of how much I poisoned myself by licking the point) a classmate lent me their PaperMate.
Unlike ballpoint pens, the felt tip didn't turn my drawings into a relief, didn't transfer grooves and divots into the next page. It forced me to have a lighter touch, for fear of destroying the tip or leaking ink through to the subsequent pages. My sketches became more expressive with less effort. When the pen started to run low on ink, the drawings became even more expressive for it.

Here's a fun experiment.

Draw two thick lines on a sheet of paper (run the pens back and forth a bit), one with a Bic ballpoint and one with a PaperMate felt tip.
Wait a few seconds, give or take.
Now rub the lines with your finger.

Depending on how hard you press, they'll both bleed, but the PaperMate less so. Some people love this quality to the Bic's ink. I personally hated the bloom effect if I didn't do it intentionally… which was never.
Also, blue fingertips, yuck.

Compose

In case it wasn't already obvious, I have very particular tastes when it comes to my tools and supplies.
My sketchbook of choice was the Moleskine hardcover. The rigid cover and spine protected my drawings when it was jostled around in my bag. I was also enamored with the, admittedly, romantic notion that someday someone may "discover" my sketchbook. I wanted to give it the best chance of surviving… a Leonardo in waiting.
The sketches I'd do in the Moleskine were all over the place. My "notes" on HVAC systems (architecture) would be interleaved with studies of a nude (drawing class). I could, and did, have multiple sketchbooks to address this. But inevitably, a detailed portrait (again, life drawing) would be followed by a doodle of an anthropomorphic bit of excrement ("literal" illustration).

Along with my short-term memory, I'd discovered another flaw I needed to address; my thoughts and memories are concurrent rather than sequential.
I always found myself tearing pages out of this beautifully bound sketchbook. A habit I simply couldn't afford.

I wish I had an amusing parallel story to how I came to use Post-it® notes, but I, simply, don't.
I think there was a stack of them in an unexpectedly long meeting. I grabbed a pack and began scribbling on one, peeling it off and scribbling on the next when I ran out of room.

One of the benefits of Post-its is being able to spread out the notes into a sort of global view of captured thoughts. For myself however, the biggest draw is the ability to re-order them at will

"Step two is actually Step three?" (peel, stick)

TL;DR

Applications, tools and utilities have made it simple for me to capture, literally. Copy-Paste helps compose, order and sort those thoughts.
But at what cost?
If a picture says a thousand words, I lose out on that efficiency when I go back to tapping out words on a keyboard. If "drawing is about expression" I deny myself that release.
To be clear, I take advantage of digital tools all the time. I'm typing this post on a laptop, not hand painting inscrutable iconography on a cave wall. However, I believe the comparative slowness of hand drawing forces myself to operate at "human" speed.
Digital design is still design for people after all. My entry point to "Sketch" is, and will remain sketch.
