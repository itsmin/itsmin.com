I've always been a bit of a media glutton, collecting over 500 DVDs during my college years, and hundreds of VHS tapes written and rewritten with the anime or kungfu flick dujour. A shared cable line in an off campus apartment brought about the KPOP music video collection. The point is, I've always gone out of the way to not only watch, but gather and manage and share my media collections.

Fast forward several years and moves of several large/heavy boxes (full of DVDs, CDs, VCDs and external drives) and I found myself as the sole UX resource at a small startup called [CastTV][casttv]. CastTV, in a nutshell, was a video search engine made visible to the public via a consumer website. 

For the past 6 years, the bulk of my working hours have been spent on imagining some aspect of the experience of watching TV without a grid. More specifically, non-linear methods of discovering and consuming (nee watching) TV.

Since CastTV's acquisition by TMS in 2010, and the subsequent shuttering of the consumer website, I've had little professional reason to continue working on this "new TV experience" - and yet, here I am introducing [LanCaster][lancaster]. 

Lancaster is an evolving prototype, an interface to the experiences that happen before, during, and after a video is watched in **my** household. It's a homebrew home entertainment system that has big aspirations.
