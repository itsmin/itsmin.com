I've always been a bit of a media glutton, collecting well over 500 DVDs during my college years, and hundreds of VHS tapes written and rewritten with the anime or kungfu flick dujour. A shared cable line in an off campus apartment brought about the KPOP music videos, TV commercials and "naughty" clips library. The point is, I've always gone out of the way to not only watch, but gather, manage and share my media collections.

Fast forward several years and moves of several large/heavy boxes (full of DVDs, CDs, VCDs and hard drives) and I found myself as the sole design and user experience resource at a small startup called [CastTV][casttv]. CastTV, in a nutshell, was a video search engine made visible to the public via a consumer website. 

For the past 6 years, the bulk of my working hours have been spent on imagining some aspect of the experience of watching TV without a grid. More specifically, non-linear methods of discovering and consuming (nee watching) TV.

Since CastTV's acquisition by Tribune Media Services in 2010, and the subsequent shuttering of the consumer website, I've had little professional reason to continue working on this "new TV experience" - and yet, here I am introducing [LanCaster][lancaster]. 

Lancaster is an evolving prototype, an interface to the experiences that happen before, during, and after a video is watched. I'm sorting through my various documents, PSDs and projects in my local git repo; editing to put a presentable, sharable face on the project.

As I find myself returning to the enjoyment of the media I've, in some form, tried to catalogue over the past few years, I wanted a snapshot to come back to. This is primarily a personal effort to archive my work with/for CastTV, the raw development of a portfolio piece...

...but I'd be lying if I said the desired end result isn't a homebrew home entertainment system for *myself* that has aspirations beyond my walls.
