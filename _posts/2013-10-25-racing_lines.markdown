The earliest toy I can remember playing with was a bright orange race car. It was a Tonka toy of A.J. Foyt's 1977 Indy 500 winner. It came with a matching orange support van, but it was the race car that stuck in memory because it looked exctly like a "fast" does to a four year old. The action figures that also came with the set were long lost and the van became transport for the Cheerios.

As much as I loved the car, most hours were spent laying down the rings of Cheerios that would define the pit straight or the sequence of lefts and rights that formed the track. Up to that point of my life, I'd yet to make neighborhood friends so I had no one to run against and cars were the loud, ugly things that my mom kept saying I shouldn't stand too close to.
