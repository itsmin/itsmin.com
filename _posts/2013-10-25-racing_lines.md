lessons in context for a car lover

The earliest toy I can remember playing with was a bright orange race car. It was a Tonka toy of A.J. Foyt's 1977 Indy 500 winner. It came with a matching orange support van and action figures, but it was the race car that stuck in memory because it looked exactly like fast does to a four year old. The action figures were quickly lost and the van became little more than transport for cereal.

As much as I loved the car, most hours were spent laying down the rings of Cheerios that would define the pit straight or the sequence of lefts and rights that formed the track. Up to that point of my life, I'd yet to make neighborhood friends so I had no one to run against, no one to race. This toy car, and the tracks I'd lay down to navigate was the foundation of a life long love of racing. 

Looking back at those Saturday mornings as a child, racing was always about where I was on the lines of Cheerios I'd carefully distributed across the living room floor. It was about understanding the track, reading what came next, shaping a line that wouldn't cause me, I mean the car, to spin and lose control.

I came to believe that racing is never between the racers. It's a racer's push/pull conversation with the track. And then, like any enthusiast of anything, I realized racing became an allegory for life.

Where are you on your road? What sort of conversation are you having with your track? Are you accelerating down a long straight knowing there's no obstacles in your path? Are you slowing down before entering a curve, understanding that it'll ultimately get you through it faster?

The people in your life are much like the other racers on the track. Some are trying to block your way forward. Yet others are clearing a way for you, as you follow in their calm air.
