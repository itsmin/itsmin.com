			<h4><b>MANTLE DESIGN SYSTEM</b></h4>
			<div class="definition">
				A figurative cloak symbolizing preeminence or authority;
				Something that covers, enfolds, or envelops;
				The part of the interior of a terrestrial planet and especially the earth that lies beneath the crust and above the central core

			<h4><b>Learning From Predix</b></h4>
			<div class="description">
				GE Digital's Oil & Gas Digital group, like the other verticals of GE, utilized <a href="https://www.predix-ui.com/#/home" target="_blank">Predix</a> to guide all software UI design.
				<br><br>
				Through formal and informal collaboration with the Predix team and further study of our own customers, an effort was started to create UI components specific to Oil & Gas Digital's needs.

			<h4><b>Laying the Foundations of Mantle</b></h4>
			<div class="description">
				With the announcement that GE will divest their shares in Baker Hughes, a GE Company, efforts were started to create a stand alone design system tailored for use by BHGE.
				<br><br>
				Evolving existing applications and creating visualizations that matched the innovative data science work proved to be more of an exercise in coordinating people than designing the UI components themselves.

			<h4><b>Building the Layers</b></h4>
			<div class="description">
				Mantle as a design system is something I've approached architecturally. Designing forward looking UIs, building prototypes to prove ideas are doable now (not later) and documenting everything in a manner that it can be utilized by teams on the other side of the planet is an orchestration that's equal parts demanding and rewarding.
